# 👋 Hi, I'm Kaneki Ken (a.k.a. Rahul Kodunga)

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a B.Tech Computer Science student from Dehradun with a strong interest in building intelligent systems that serve a purpose. I come from an army background, and my curiosity drives me across a diverse set of fields—AI/ML, web development, embedded systems, and more.

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

### 🧠 AI/ML Projects
- **Kumaoni Language Translation Model**  
  Building a two-way translation system (English ↔ Kumaoni) using MBart50 and Hugging Face to preserve and promote the Kumaoni language and culture.
  
- **AI-Powered Ticket Reservation System**  
  Backend in Django, AI chatbot in Rasa, database in MongoDB. Automating the railway ticket booking process with intelligent conversations.

- **Fire Detection System**  
  Real-time fire detection using YOLOv8, potentially with thermal filters for invisible fire recognition. Running on normal camera feed with optimized processing.

- **AI Image Filters (Anime Face Swap)**  
  Exploring models like U-GAT-IT for anime-style image transformation. Focus on memory optimization (Colab, 15GB GPU).

- **Virtual Scene Generation**  
  Creating immersive VR environments based on weather data using generative models.

### 💻 Web & Full Stack Development
- **Krishi Seva - Blockchain Inventory System**  
  IoT-based inventory tracking system using ESP32 for real-time item updates, blockchain-style transaction logging, and MongoDB storage.

- **Task Manager in Streamlit**  
  Custom desktop simulation with scheduling algorithms, resource usage visualization, and real-time simulation controls.

- **React-based Apps**  
  Countdown timer, secure login, DOB-to-age calculator, quiz app, class-based counters, etc. Built as part of full-stack learning.
